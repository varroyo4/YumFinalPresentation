            \n•<li>Since Kotlin boils down and compiles to the same JVM bytecode as Java, Kotlin and Java are easily interchangeable and allow for each language to interact with other!</li>

        <ul>
            \n•<li>XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language\n</li>

    <!-- view binding -->
    <string name="binding_q_one">What is View Binding?</string>
    <string name="binding_a_one">
        <ul>
            \n•<li>For some context, Android allows the user to interact between Kotlin or Java code and XML.\n</li>

        </ul>
    </string>
    <string name="binding_q_two">Why is View Binding superior?</string>
    <string name="binding_a_two">
        <ul>
            \n•<li>View Binding allows for easier code to be written for interaction between views.\n</li>
            \n•<li>Allows for safer way to reference XML layout views.\n</li>
            <li>For example in Kotlin synthetics, if you had 2 views named the same from 2 separate layout files, it would be difficult for the program to differentiate them.</li>
            <li>In View Binding it creates a way for you to utilize the correct view being used. The binding object created allows you to reference the view that is tied with that layout file.</li>

    <string name="binding_q_three">How can I get started on implementing it correctly?</string>
    <string name="binding_a_three">
        <ul>

                ___viewBinding {\n
                    ___enabled = true\n
                ___}\n
